# Introduction

You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. We use @citeR and @rohan.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-data....



# Data {#sec-data}

Some of our data is of penguins (@fig-bills), from @palmerpenguins.

```{r}
#| label: fig-bills
#| fig-cap: Bills of penguins
#| echo: false

cleaned_data <-
  raw_data |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  separate(col= time_period, 
           into = c("year","month"),
           sep = "-") |>
  mutate(date = lubridate:: ymd(paste(year, month, "01", sep = "-")))
```

Talk more about it.

And also planes (@fig-planes). (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work well once you have enough text.)

```{r}
#| label: fig-planes
#| fig-cap: Relationship between wing length and width
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

#analysis_data <- read_csv(here::here("data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv"))

#analysis_data |> 
  #ggplot(aes(x = width, y = length)) +
  #geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  #theme_minimal() +
  #labs(x = "Wing width (mm)",
       #y = "Wing length (mm)")
```

Talk way more about it. 


# Discussion

## First discussion point {#sec-first-point}

If my paper were 10 pages, then should be be at least 2.5 pages. The discussion is a chance to show off what you know and what you learnt from all this. 

## Second discussion point

## Third discussion point

## Weaknesses and next steps

Weaknesses and next steps should also be included.
